<p>Welcome to my website this is my portfolio showcasing my job history, credentials and code. I've been programming for less then a year now and I hope to one day create my own social media website called Tiyon. Its a really complex website with a lot of moving peieces so I have my work cut out for me as for this website its for employers looking to get to know me better. To see my credentials, school history, certifications, and degrees visit the Credentials page. To view some code I have worked on to see my skillset visit the Code Examples page. To view my resume visit the Resume page and to know more about me visit the about me page.</p>
