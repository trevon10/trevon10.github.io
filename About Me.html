<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, my name Is Trevon Smith-Ellerbe I’m twenty-three years old and I love to code it’s become my passion. Let’s back up a bit, I was born May 24, 2000, in Washington DC and lived there until I was three, then I moved to North Carolina with my mom, stepdad and sister. I lived there until I was ten then I moved to Okinawa, Japan where I soaked up all sorts of Japanese culture most notably anime, my favorite being Darker Than Black. I lived in Okinawa until I was thirteen then I moved back to North Carolina, it felt good to be back home I missed my dad and my cousins who live in DC. I went to high school in North Carolina and that’s where I first met html my first programming language. It was easy to learn but I didn’t know if coding was the career for me my passion was music, so I studied piano and digital audio interfaces in high school. I graduated in the AVID program where I learned to take notes, ask questions, and study it has come in handy while in college. <br> <br>

	After high school I attended Coastal Community College where I studied to become a software engineer, at the time I didn’t know how limited their program was, but I was eager to get a degree. After my first I started hallucinating I didn’t quite understand them at the time I thought the signs of something bigger and with my reserved nature I didn’t disclose them to my family. After my first year I dropped out and moved to DC while trying to make sense of what I was experiencing. I wasn’t sure if it was stress, a higher power, or delusion but they seem to get worse in the city, so I decided to move back. That’s when I started learning my second programming language Java which is my favorite next to PHP. I tried school again and I seemed to do well but the delusions never left so it was a struggle to learn. Eventually they overcame me again and I dropped out a second time when I was finally institutionalized. They didn’t have a diagnosis for me at first it would take four more visits for me to finally be diagnosed with schizophrenia. <br> <br>

	When I eventually became stable, I returned to school where I took a formal Java course at Coastal Community College, but I yearned for an opportunity to take my coding to the next level. That’s when I decided to apply to Wake Tech where I heard they have the best coding instructors in the country. I plan to get a Applied Science degree and transferring for my Bachelors at either ECU or A&T. My hobbies include making music with Logic Pro X, writing movie script in Word, creating spreadsheets in Excel, coding in VS Code, and yoga. I have been through a lot, and I hope to grow and become a stronger person because of it each day I’m thankful that I have an opportunity to beat my illness a become a example of beating the odds. Thanks for visiting my website.
